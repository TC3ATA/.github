# TC3ATA - Amateur Radio Experiments for Space (TÃ¼rkiye)

## Overview

This repository documents a step-by-step roadmap for amateur radio experiments, focusing on HF, VHF, UHF, APRS, SDR, CW, digital modes, and antenna designs. The goal is to progress from basic radio communication to advanced satellite and high-altitude balloon projects.

## Roadmap

### **1. QSO Logbook Development**
- Developing a logbook application using Python or a web-based solution.
- Integrating with QRZ and LOTW for QSO record keeping.

### **2. APRS Transmission Using ESP**
- Using ESP32 and a GPS module to transmit location data over APRS.
- Testing APRS-IS and RF transmissions.

### **3. 40M Monoband Antenna and Morse Paddle Development**
- Designing a wire antenna for the 40-meter band and measuring SWR.
- Creating a Morse paddle using mechanical or 3D printing techniques.

### **4. Pixie V4 Construction and Toroidal Coils**
- Building a low-power (QRP) Pixie V4 transceiver for CW.
- Working with toroidal coils for impedance matching and signal filtering.

### **5. CW Communication Tests**
- Receiving and decoding HF CW signals.
- Conducting QSO attempts using a 5W output.

### **6. POTA & SOTA Activation Tests**
- Setting up portable stations and testing mobile antennas.
- Establishing long-distance QRP communication.

### **7. 25W YM3XUU Conversion and Field Testing**
- Conducting field tests with a 25W output power under the YM3XUU call sign.
- Evaluating antenna performance and signal directionality.

### **8. Enhancing ESP APRS for Mobile Integration**
- Connecting the ESP APRS device to mobile phones via Bluetooth or WiFi.
- Sending APRS messages from a smartphone.

### **9. TIDH3 Modes (HF and VHF Digital Modes)**
- Experimenting with FT8, JS8Call, RTTY, SSTV, and PSK31.
- Using WSJT-X and FLdigi for digital communication.

### **10. TIDH3 Bluetooth Communication**
- Enabling digital modes via Bluetooth connectivity with a phone or tablet.
- Developing mobile SDR interfaces for HF/VHF.

### **11. SDR Receiver and Spectrum Analysis**
- Receiving signals from NOAA, METEOR, AO-91, and ISS SSTV using SDR.
- Analyzing and processing the RF spectrum.

### **12. ISS (International Space Station) Reception**
- Capturing amateur radio signals from the ISS.
- Attempting voice or data communication with astronauts.

### **13. SSTV (Slow Scan Television) Experiments**
- Receiving SSTV images via HF or ISS transmissions.
- Using Robot36 and MMSSTV for image decoding.

### **14. High-Altitude Balloon Test Using ESP**
- Designing a lightweight communication payload for APRS tracking.
- Conducting endurance and atmospheric testing.

### **15. Uno DX Study**
- Exploring Uno DX technology for digital communication.
- Testing Uno DX in various frequency bands.

### **16. Uno DX Testing**
- Conducting QSOs with Uno DX and evaluating signal quality.
- Experimenting with digital modes on Uno DX.
